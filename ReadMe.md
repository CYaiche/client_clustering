# Olist Customer Segmentation and Client Clustering Project 📊

Welcome to the **Olist Customer Segmentation and Client Clustering** project repository! The aim is to understand different client profiles from the Olist client dataset. The project explores different **unsupervised learning**  approaches. 
## Exploratory Work 

 contains a detailed data exploration and cleaning process.
## Different Clustering Approaches 📈

 various clustering approaches to achieve customer segmentation and client profiling:

### Customer Segmentation : 

- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilizing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary values) and additional features like localization, satisfaction, and payment installments for segmentation.
- **PCA-Enhanced Clustering**: Incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize segmentation results.
- **Alternative Clustering Algorithms**: Exploring Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN for a deeper understanding of client profiles.

### Segmentation Maintenance 🔄

We recommend how often to update the segmentation using the **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** to ensure its relevance. The study encompasses:
